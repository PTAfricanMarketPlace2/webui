                    <p>Cross-border trade is a major feature of African economies, as it creates jobs, contributes to food and energy security and alleviates poverty. We are here to connect East African women with products to sell with potential customers who want to purchase their products. </p>
                    <p>Sauti Africa and African Markerplace are also looking to assist women looking to start or maintain their small businesses. There is a lot that goes into selling products, especially cross-border. Our main goal is to ensure these women are educated on all that is involved with selling their products in a safe manner.</p>
